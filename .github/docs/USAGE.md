### 4. Booting from USB Drive
> [!!WARNING]
> ðŸ’» On all systems bios is different so this process can looks different for you

If you have PC search in google "{your motherboard model} bios key" or if you have laptop search instead "{your laptop model} bios key"
(generally in 99% it will be one of these keybinds:  F1, F2, F10, F12, Del, or Esc.) 

After that there is two methods how you can boot from usb drive:
#### Change bios boot order
> [!IMPORTANT]

 - Boot manually from usb drive and back to the windows

 with first way after you change the boot order, your system will be automatically booting from usb drive every system startup until you will change boot order back

 with second way you just booting usb drive one time and you need to do it every system restart when you want to use the cheat
