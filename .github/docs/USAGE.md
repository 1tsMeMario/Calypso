### 1. Download

### 2. Compile
- Open Calypso folder and start ``build.bat`` it will automatically compile binaries and copy them to the folder

(optional: you can open ``CalypsoUM.sln`` and ``CalypsoEFI.efi`` to build project by yourself)

### 3. USB Setup
- Insert your usb drive to the system and make ``format`` to the ``NTFS`` or ``FAT32``

- ``Download`` efi shell from [this link](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2-archive/raw/master/ShellBinPkg/UefiShell/X64/Shell.efi)

- ``Rename`` efi sheel from ``shell.efi`` to ``bootx64.efi``

- Copy ``CalypsoEFI.efi``, ``Startup.nsh`` from Calypso folder and renamed before ``bootx64.efi`` to the usb drive like this:

```
USB:.
 â”‚   CalypsoEFI.efi
 â”‚   Startup.nsh
 â”‚
 â””â”€â”€â”€EFI
      â””â”€â”€â”€Boot
              bootx64.efi
```
(``EFI`` and ``Boot`` are folders that you need to create)

- Calypso EFI Setup Done!

### 4. Booting from USB Drive
> [!NOTE] 
> ðŸ’» On all systems bios is different so this process can looks different for you

If you have PC search in google ``{your motherboard model} bios key`` or if you have laptop search instead ``{your laptop model} bios key``
(generally in 99% it will be one of these keybinds:  ``F1``, ``F2``, ``F10``, ``F12``, ``Del``, or ``Esc``) 

After that there is two methods how you can boot from usb drive:
<details>
<summary>Boot manually from usb drive</summary>
  
  > with manually booting you need to do it every system restart when you want to use the cheat
  
</details>

<details>
<summary>Change bios boot order </summary>

  > after you change the boot order, your system will be automatically booting from usb drive every system startup until you will change boot order back

</details>


### 5. Finish
- Start ``CS2``
- Open Calypso folder again and start ``CalypsoUM.exe`` it will automatically create config file
